### Pandas

* Pandas is an open-source Python library that provides easy-to-use and powerful data structures, as well as data analysis tools. The name "Pandas" is derived from the term "Panel Data," which is a term used in statistics and econometrics to describe multi-dimensional structured data sets. It was created by Wes McKinney in 2008 and has since become one of the most popular libraries for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

* Pandas primarily offers two data structures: Series and DataFrame. A Series is a one-dimensional array-like object that can hold any data type, while a DataFrame is a two-dimensional tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). These data structures make it easy to manipulate, clean, and analyze data in Python.
